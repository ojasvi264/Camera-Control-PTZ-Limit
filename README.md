# Camera Control System

## Introduction
This is a simple web based camera control system, where you can turn on/off your webcam. 
You can also add simple zooming functionality with little bit of adding filters, taking snapshots, and mirroring the camera video.
We also added the feature to limit or restrict the PAN and TILT limit of Axis PTZ Camera for each zoom level.
